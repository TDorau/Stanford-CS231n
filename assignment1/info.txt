cd assignment1
sudo pip install virtualenv      # This may already be installed
virtualenv -p python3 .env       # Create a virtual environment (python3)
# Note: you can also use "virtualenv .env" to use your default python (usually python 2.7)
source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
# Work on the assignment for a while ...
deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment

Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run source .env/bin/activate (from within your assignment1 folder)
to re-activate the virtual environment, and deactivate again whenever you are done.
